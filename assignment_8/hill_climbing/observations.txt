Q1: Compare the graphs task2_submit.png , task3_submit.png and task4_submit.png
and write down your observations in observations.txt. Comment on which 
initialization method is better and why that is the case.

Ans: We can see that, in task2 (random init), final path-size is at around 500-600,
	 however it takes around 65-70 iteration to get there. In task3 (nearest
	 neighbour init), we see that there is a lot of variance with the change 
	 in start city with respect to both, number of iterations to converge, as
	 well as the final path-size. In the best case, the path-size is around 600-700,
	 and it takes around 15 iterations to get there. Since this method is very
	 sensitive to start city, it should be only used by taking the best case out
	 of several different start initialization. In task4 (Euclidian tour),
	 the final path-size is at around 500-600 and it is also reached in around 17-18
	 iterations. 
	 Therefore, in from the observations, we can conclude that euclidian tour init
	 is the best since random init takes too many iterations to converge and the
	 convergence of nearest neighbour init is highly sensitive to start	city.
	 Although it is not shown in the submitted graphs, I checked the answer for
	 Euclidian Tour init on various different initial cities and the results were
	 similar for all start states.


Common for Q2 to Q5:
In general, hill climbing using 3OptNeighbours is expected to converge faster
but at similar path lengths as that using 2OptNeighbours. If 2 paths are
3Opt neighbours, then they can be reached using 2 steps of 2OptNeighbours.
So, the set of paths explored would be similar, however the number of iterations
would decrease while using 3OptNeighbours. The difference in path length will
occur in cases when hill climbing using 2OptNeighbours converges but after one
more step, the path length will still decrease. In that case, hill climbing 
using 2OptNeighbours will keep going and converge to a path of lower length.
So it is guaranteed that using the union of these we will converge at a path
of length less than or equal to path length using only 2OptNeighbours. At the
end it is a trade-off between the optimality of the solution and running time.
This is because even though the on the graphs various convergence values are
similar, they tend to be lower for the 3OptNeighbours case.

Q2: Visually inspect the two graphs task2_submit.png and task6_submit.png and 
write down your observations in observations.txt. Comment on which neighbour
generating method is better (if at all) and why?

Ans: We can see that both the methods converge to paths of similar lengths, 
	 however, using 2OptNeighbours along with 2OptNeighbours makes the
	 algorithm converge in lower number of iterations. However, each iteration
	 takes much longer time. So, overall time using 3OptNeighbours is more than
	 using only 2OptNeighbours whereas the convergence point is similar. So,
	 using only 2OptNeighbours is better in this case.

Q3: Compare the two graphs task3_submit.png and task7_submit.png and write down 
your observations in observations.txt. Comment your opinion on which neighbour 
generating method is better in this case and why?

Ans: In this case, we can see that out of the 5 starting points, minimum path 
	 length is similar for both the algorithms. However, using 3OptNeighbours
	 makes the algorithm converge in lesser number of iterations. However, the
	 main advantage that we get is that the dependence on start state is much
	 less while also using 3OptNeighbours. The reason for this is explained in
	 the common part. Thus using 3OptNeighbours in this case will make our
	 algorithm less error prone, so this is better.

Q4: Compare the graphs task4_submit.png and task8_submit.png and write down 
your observations in observations.txt. Comment your opinion on which neighbour 
generating method is better in this case and why?

Ans: In this case, both the methods converge to similar path lengths in nearly
	 same number of iterations. Thus in that sense, both algorithms are more
	 or less equivalent. However, since each iteration for 
	 3OptNeighbours takes more time, in practice we might prefer to use 
	 only 2OptNeighbours.
